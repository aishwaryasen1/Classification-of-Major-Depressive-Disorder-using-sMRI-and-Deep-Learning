# Tracking-of-MDD-using-ML
Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has always presented a challenge, as the symptoms manifest differently in distinct individuals.  This study is thus motivated by the need for a generalizable method for the effectual diagnosis of MDD as well as an in-depth comprehension of the factors responsible for its genesis. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, which presents a non-intrusive method by which physical abnormalities in the brain and consequently the brain architecture can be studied, has been used in this paper to conduct several studies in an attempt to better understand the various intricacies and implications of MDD. MDD data consisting of brain scansand patient phenotypic data acquired from the Rest-meta-MDD project has been used for the development of convolutional neural networks for the diagnosis as well as severity prediction of MDD. Further, the relationship between age, gender, education, and the prevalence and severity of MDD has been examined using various machine learning algorithms and statistical tests which all point to the conclusion that gender has the least influence on MDD. In order to abate the lack of transparency in the predictions made by the models, a state-of-the-art explainable AI - SHapley Additive exPlanations has been utilized to comprehend the results.

This project is being published as a research paper, hence the codes cannot be made publicly available at this time.
